An AI-powered image understanding system that combines <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>OCR</strong>, <strong>Image Captioning</strong>, and <strong>Large Language Models</strong> to let users have natural conversations with images.
</p>

# 🚀 Overview

Traditional image classification systems produce only a single prediction.

This project goes much further.

Instead of relying on one AI model, the uploaded image is analyzed simultaneously by multiple specialized vision models. The extracted visual information is stored inside a relational database, and an LLM uses that structured knowledge to answer natural language questions about the image.

Rather than asking:

> "What is this image?"

Users can ask:

- What objects are present?
- Is there any text?
- Describe the entire scene.
- What products are visible?
- Count the detected people.
- Summarize everything found in the image.

The application behaves like an AI assistant that can "see" the image and discuss it intelligently.

## 🎯 Object Detection (YOLOv8)

Detects:

- People
- Vehicles
- Animals
- Electronics
- Furniture
- Everyday objects

Features

- Bounding boxes
- Confidence scores
- Annotated output images

---

## 🧠 Image Captioning (BLIP)

Generates human-like captions describing the entire scene.

Example

> "A person sitting at a desk using a laptop while drinking coffee."

---

## 🏷️ Image Classification (ViT)

Predicts the overall category of the image using Vision Transformers.

---

## 📝 OCR (EasyOCR)

Extracts visible text from:

- Documents
- Receipts
- Signboards
- Screenshots
- Product packaging

Supports multiple languages.

---

## 💾 Structured Metadata Storage

All AI outputs are converted into structured JSON and stored in the database.

Stored information includes:

- Object labels
- Bounding boxes
- Confidence scores
- OCR text
- Generated captions
- Image classifications

---

## 💬 Chat with Images (Multimodal RAG)

Users can ask questions such as:

> Is there any text in this image?

> What objects are detected?

> Summarize this image.

> Describe everything you found.

Instead of analyzing the image again, LangChain retrieves the stored metadata from the database and sends it to a local LLM (Llama 3 via Ollama), enabling intelligent conversations about the image.

# 🚀 Engineering Highlights

### ✅ Asynchronous Processing

Heavy AI inference runs in FastAPI `BackgroundTasks`, ensuring the API remains responsive.

---

### ✅ Efficient Model Loading

Large AI models are initialized once during application startup using FastAPI lifespan events, reducing latency and avoiding repeated memory allocation.

---

### ✅ Multimodal AI Pipeline

Integrates multiple computer vision models into a unified inference pipeline for comprehensive image understanding.

---

### ✅ Structured AI Metadata

Instead of storing raw predictions, the application organizes AI outputs into structured JSON for efficient retrieval and reasoning.

---

### ✅ Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Visual information is transformed into textual context, allowing a local LLM to answer image-related questions without directly processing pixels.

---

### ✅ Scalable Architecture

Designed with separate frontend, backend, AI inference, and database layers for maintainability and future expansion.
